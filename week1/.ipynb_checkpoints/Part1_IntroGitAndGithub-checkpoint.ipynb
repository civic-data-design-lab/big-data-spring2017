    "# Git Crash Course: Setting up Git and Github (Command Line) \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration is key when working with a group on a coding project. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. In other words, Git is software that keeps careful track of changes to text files (like code scripts and web pages) in order to allow users to preserve edit histories and merge multiple versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Github is a website and web service that hosts your remote repository and provides easy ways to store, work with, and share your projects. Working with Github is easy, there are two main ways you can work with Github, via command line, or with a desktop GUI. The instructions below will show you how to get started on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Sign up for a Github account\n",
    "\n",
    "Sign up for a Github account on the Github site in which you can host projects and maintain repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Github Homepage](http://www.github.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Create, join, or fork repositories in your Github account\n",
    "\n",
    "Repositories are project locations in Github. A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. You can create copies of repositories that other people have created by ‘forking’ it from their account to yours. Repositories can have parallel versions called branches. The main branch is called the ‘master’ branch. Branches are used when you want to make try changes, but don’t want to change or break a working existing version of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the Github site, let’s create a repository. Repositories can be used for many projects, allowing you to collaborate, share, and modify scripts, programs, and websites. Project repositories can be named just about anything, and you should pick something relevant to your project. For example, if you are creating a repository to hold python scripts that scrape data, name it something like **\"big-data-eater\"** and use it for your project code and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a website using Github Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use Github to create a simple webpage repository. In this repository, we have the HTML, CSS, and JS required for our webpage. A feature of Github is the ability to create a homepage using something called [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Github pages to host a static page, you have to name your repository very specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps detail creating a repository and setting up the initial settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Click on the Repositories tab on your main profile page.\n",
    "\n",
    "On your Github profile page, click on the Repositories tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. In the upper right corner, select ‘New’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii. In the Create a new repository window, set up your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name the repository **‘username.github.io’**, and replace username with your Github username. Give the repository a description, make it public, and initialize it with a README. Don’t worry about the license at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iv. Click Create.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have an empty repository set up in which you can add files and set up a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get Git setup so we can interact with it via command line on our local machine to create, edit, and manage files.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Check if Git is installed on your Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving back to our local machine, we need to get git and Github setup so we can work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are using Mac:** Using Terminal, we are going to check for Git, and if it is not found, we will download and install necessary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are using Windows:** Git does not work easily from the Windows command prompt. To easily use command line to interact with Github, you need to install Github for desktop where you can use Git Bash. This is a command line interface that allows you to run commands to create repositories, rectify file differences, and push commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Download Github for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once downloaded, proceed below, but instead of using Terminal, you use Git Bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Open Terminal/Git Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Check git installation by entering the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git –-version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "if you have Git installed, you will see the version. If you get an error, or you don’t see the version, you need to install Git. Install Git from the downloads page on the main Git project homepage.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://git-scm.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Download Git for your machine. A wizard will lead you through the installation. You can select the defaults for installation. You might need to restart your machine after installation to get it to take effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Authenticate with Github using SSH\n",
    "\n",
    "Our local machine needs to communicate with the Github servers in order to retrieve and post project documents. This requires authentication with the Github servers, meaning that we have enter our username and password to get to our Github files. If we are making alot of changes, entering our username and password everytime you push a file to the server can get tedious.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set up your machine to communicate with Github via SSH. SSH is a secure connection in which we provide Github a unique address for our computer that it will recognize and trust, so we can communicate between the two without constantly having to reauthenticate. It will give you instant access to your Github folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to create an SSH key unique to our local machine that Github can store and recognize. Create an SSH key on your machine by following the instructions at the following link. The steps will lead you through setting up a unique key that allows Github to ‘trust’ your machine. Take the key created on your machine and paste into your account on Github.com. This key allows you to connect to Github via Terminal without entering your Github username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Github site contains very nice instructions on how to do this. Before you continue the tutorial, set up SSH authentication by following the instructions on the Github help pages at the following address:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Create a Directory for Github Projects on your Local Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we want to setup a Github folder on your computer that can contain local copies of our Github project directories. The easiest way to edit and change code is to work on it on your own machine. You can then sync the repository folders with the Github servers so others can see and use your code modifications, and you can pull changes others have made.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a **github** directory on your machine. We are going to set up a **github** folder within the Documents folder of our local profile (documents/github) using Terminal and some basic command line to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Open Terminal, change your current location to your Documents directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cd to change directories on your machine to the location you want to store documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd documents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can use **pwd** to find out your present working directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Create a new directory called ‘github’\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a new folder that will hold our github projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "mkdir github\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an empty folder called github in our Documents folder. We will use this for storing local copies of our github repositories and as working space when we edit and modify projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### iii. Change the working directory to your new github directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Change directories to your new github directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd github\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘github’ folder is now your working directory and commands we run will be happening in this directory. We will work locally on our Github repositories in this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "You saw this require some command line work. For documentation on additional command line commands and shortcuts, the following cheatsheet can be very helpful. Descriptions of the commands we just used, if you are curious, are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet/wiki/Terminal-Cheatsheet-for-Mac-(-basics-)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Clone a copy of the repository you want to work on\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to edit and change code is to work on it on your own machine, bringing a copy of the repository to your local drive, modifying the code using a development environment on your own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two. You can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. With your SSH authentication setup, clone your first repo to your local drive using the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:<Github username>/<Github username>.github.io.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Change your working directory to your cloned repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd <Github username>.github.io\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look in your finder window, you will see a ‘username.github.io’ folder now exists in your github folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6b. Create a Repository Remotely using Command Line using Git Init\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we created a repository on the Github webpage. What if we want to create one from the command line (remotely) in an existing directory and then push that to Github so others can collaborate with us?\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to remotely create a repository are detailed by the [Github docs](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Make edits locally in your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to your ‘username.github.io’ folder that you have created, you can add, edit, modify, and delete files from this directory. This directory is local, but we will use the command line to sync it with the repo on the Github site. This is where Github shines, you can fully edit documents and files on your machine, then synchronize them with your repositories on the Github site. This is excellent for group work and versioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Edit the README\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit the README to contain your name and some information on your project. This README contains the text that is visible to visitors to the Github repo. Here you can descriptions on what your project is, what it does, and how people that fork a copy can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could write the date and that this is your Github homepage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Create our website... write some code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin our project. Working in the project directory on your machine, you can work with or create almost anything. For example, let’s create a basic HTML document. Open a text document, copy and paste the following code snip. We are going to call this **index.html**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "\t<meta charset=\"utf-8\"> \n",
    "\t<title>Hello World</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "\t<h1>Hello World</h1>\n",
    "\t<p>I wuz here.</p>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the document in the **username.github.io** directory as **index.html**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Use git status to check the working status and synchronization of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having made the changes above and saved them, go back to terminal. Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This checks the current status of changes. You should see that our **README.md** was modified, and that **index.html** is not yet tracked. However, these files are not yet staged to be committed to the online repository. In order to commit this files to our online repository, we need to stage them first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Stage our documents for commit\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done working, stage your changes by using:\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add <filename>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "This puts the files into the Git staging area. You can add multiple files to your staging area at once. If you edit many files on your machine, when you are done, put them each into the staging area and you can sync them with the online repository all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage our files using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add README.md\n",
    "git add index.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to stage all files, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the result by typing in git status again to see that the changes are ready to be committed. If you ever need to unstage anything, use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git reset HEAD <filename>\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important to note:** files are not staged in their entirety, rather, changes to the files are staged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Commit our files to our repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are happy with your edits and you have made all your modifications, we are ready to commit the files and update the repository. We start locally - that is, with the repository stored in our local instance of Git. Remember, Git acts as an intermediary between us and our edits. When we change files on our local machines, Git keeps track of changes, but we need to commit those changes to the local repository so that Git knows we'd like to consider this a checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best practice to add a comment to your commit that describes the changes you made to the files. For example, for this exercise, we can say we ‘added the hello-world.html document and updated the readme’. This helps others working with your code stay organized and informed on what you did that made this commit worthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To commit our files, we use git commit. We add a –m flag for the message we want to include with our commit. In terminal, still in your working directory and with our files staged, use the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git commit –m “added hello-world.html and updated readme”\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This commits our changes to the local repository.  You will see a note that files in your master branch were changed and created.\n",
    " \n",
    "## 10. Synchronize files by pushing them to Github\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step is push the files to the remote repository on the Github website to synchronize them for the rest of our team and any others that want to work with our files. We do this using git push. The syntax for this is **git push origin branchname**. This will push the file to the remote origin and match it to the name of the branch. If the branch doesn’t exist, it will be created. To push our files to Github, use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git push origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to enter your password to authenticate once more upon hitting enter. This will push our master branch to Github and sync our files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go online to your Github profile page and check the ‘username.github.io’ repository. You should see your files and modifications! Wash, rinse, and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. View your Website\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit your Github site to see your page!\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a browser and navigate to:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://yourusername.github.io\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats, you have created your first github repo, and a new website in the process!\n",
    "\n",
    "===\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Incorporate changes from Github\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be circumstances where you want to incorporate changes made by others into the repository on your local drive.  In this case, you can log into terminal and use git pull. Git pull will retrieve new work done by other people and merge the local changes with changes made by others. Syntax appears like the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git pull origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on this, read the following at the Github help pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. Working with Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have been working with our ‘master’ branch. The ‘master’ branch is the main branch of our repository, and should always be kept working and clean. If we want to work on a copy that is different than the live ‘master’ branch, we can create a working branch that has a copy of all of the files in the master branch, then try out changes on the working branch so you don’t break code that is in the master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that creating new branches will not create new local file directories. That is, if you make changes to a local file while a non-master branch is checked out, the changes are stored in the local Git repository, but the original local file is unchanged (as it is represented by the master branch in Git).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Terminal, to create a branch, follow the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Create a branch based on the master branch\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a branch based on the master branch, use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git checkout –b <new branch name> <existing branch name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git checkout –b test-changes master\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "to create a new branch called test-changes of the master branch. (Technically the master part at the end is unnecessary, but always better to be verbose).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Show all local branches by using the branch command\n",
    "\n",
    "Show all branches of the repository using the following command:\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Note:**An asterisk will appear next to the current working branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii. Switching between branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **git checkout** to switch between branches. Switching back to the master branch would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iv. Merge branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging branches is easy. To merge **test-changes** back into master, change to your master branch using checkout, and then use the merge command.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "git merge test-changes\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### v. Commit and Push a Branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches can be commited to the local repository and synced to the remote repository (on the Github site) using the same **push** process described in the steps used for the master branch above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### vi. Delete a Branch\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever need to delete a branch if you are done working in a branch and have merged changes, use the –d key of the branch command. For example, to delete test-changes, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git branch –d test-changes\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branches are a powerful component of working with Github!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. Resolving conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users working in large groups are bound to run into some conflicts when two or more people are working on the same files and changing the same lines of code. There are methods for resolving this, but unfortunately will require some manual checking. In short, conflicts will be flagged in your file when you open it in a text editor. You will have to go through your file and find conflicts, decide which one to accept, and then delete the surrounding conflict markers. This is described in nice detail on the Github help pages at the following address.\n",

    "\n",
    "Congrats, this crash course has introduced you to git and Github! Clearly there is much more to learn, including handling issues, which are like tickets individuals can open on your code, then interact with the authors to resolve, and pull requests, where authors can take modified code and merge it into their original projects.
